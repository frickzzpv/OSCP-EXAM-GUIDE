15 minutes early to verify your identity and scan your room for the proctoring staff.

Start with nmapautomator on the four boxes.

Start buffer overflow (Try finish in 1 hour and 45 minutes)

If nothing works > I Enumerate everything without autorecon.

I wrote each port on a piece of paper,along with the listening service and its version. 

I then searched ExploitDB/Google/Github/ippsec.rocks for each port and took notes.

Putting everything on paper what had to be done.

Everyone says don't rabbit hole. I was trying really hard not to, but I don't agree with that advice anymore. 

you do have enough time to just brute force investigate/try everything. If you have to rabbit hole, go for it.

I re-enumerated the box like the last one, and sure enough Autorecon missed a port.
