My exam started at 8 in the morning, 

15 minutes early to verify your identity and scan your room for the proctoring staff.

If you are able, have a good web camera. Took about 30 minutes to get everything verified.

Exam Started

I started up auto recon on the four boxes.

I Got the buffer overflow done in 1 hour and 45 minutes.

If nothing works > I Enumerate everything without autorecon.

I wrote each port on a piece of paper, 
along with the listening service and its version. 

I then searched ExploitDB/Google/Github/ippsec.rocks for each port and took notes.

Putting everything on paper helped me figure out what had to be done.

Everyone says don't rabbit hole. I was trying really hard not to, but I don't agree with that advice anymore. 
I ended trying everything I could think of on the 25 point box. 
Honestly I think you do have enough time to just brute force investigate/try everything. 
If you have to rabbit hole, go for it.

At 6:15PM I had my first user shell.

By 7:00PM I had a rootshell.

I re-enumerated the box like the last one, and sure enough Autorecon missed a port.

At 8:10PM I had another user shell.

10:30PM I had a root shell. Though I probably should of had this way earlier...

And then I went until 5:30AM with nothing else before calling it quits.
