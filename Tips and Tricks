Tips & Tricks

There are a lot of great OSCP summaries out there. Here are some of my favorite ones:

    Initial scan for every box:

        TCP: nmap -A -sV --script=default,vuln -p- --open -oA tcp_10.11.1.x 10.11.1.x

        UDP: nmap -A -sV -sU --script=default,vuln --open -oA udp_10.11.1.x 10.11.1.x

        https://github.com/jivoi/pentest (this is awesome!)

        scan whole subnet and export .gnmap into an excel file while you are studying the materials.

    Learn tools which are not mentioned in the pdf

        burp

        nikto

        cadaver

        showmount -e

        curl (this is probably the most important tool to understand and what you can do with it)

    Personal Tips (for mac / linux)

        Don't use a VMware player for accessing the websites etc

            forward the ports and use burp on your host system

            forward the ports and use the browsers on your host system

            Iterm2 with splitpane is pure gold and infinite scrolling

        Record your screen during the exam, if you miss something you can go back during the reporting and take the screenshots

        Take breaks!

        Join the discord grp if you are not a super genius who can learn everything by yourself quickly.

        Threat the whole OSCP as a video game where you move from box to box to pwn everything.

        One Note is by far the best tool to take notes imo.

Some final words:

Offsec really did an awesome job. Sometimes you hate it and sometimes you love it, it was a rollercoaster for sure. Overall I don't think I ever learned that much in 3 months than I did here. I'll move on to the CISSP now and maybe one day I'll return for OSCE since BoF was by far my most favorite part in the whole course.


Feel free to ask me anything here related to this post, as long it's not against the offsec rules I'll probably answer it.
